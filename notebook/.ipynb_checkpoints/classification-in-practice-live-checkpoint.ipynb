If our model has hyperparameters for things like regularization, how do we choose the right hyperparameters? All of these are questions that we need to handle in the practice of machine learning. \n",

    "# The Titanic Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The Titanic Data Set is something like the \"Hello world\" of machine learning. It collects information about almost 900 passengers aboard the Titanic during the fateful voyage when it crashed into an iceberg in 1912 and sank. The information includes their age; the fare they paid for their ticket (in British pounds); their sex; and the passenger class `Pclass`, with 1st class corresponding to VIP treatment and 3rd class corresponding to a much less luxurious experience. Crucially, the data set also records whether that passenger survived the sinking of the ship, with 1 indicating that the passenger survived and 0 indicating that the passenger tragically perished.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often convenient to represent tables of data as *data frames*. Data frames are implemented in multiple ways in multiple languages; we'll work with data frames through `pandas`. "
